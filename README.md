# Oscie Coherence Architecture (UCD → ACI → CUE → VE+)

**A physics-grounded framework for stable intelligent systems.**

---

Overview

The Oscie Coherence Architecture unifies:
- **UCD** — Unified Coherence Dynamics  
- **ACI** — Adaptive Coherence Intelligence  
- **CUE** — Semantic-stability engine  
- **VE+** — Energetic coherence spine  

This repo hosts the full preprint, coherence metrics, and simulated evaluations.  
It aims to enable research and development of stability-first intelligence — an alternative to scale-based AGI architectures.
